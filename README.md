X-Chat mIRC imposter, geographical cloak.

## Functions
This is a simple script for X-Chat to mimic the out-of-the-box popup/context menu functionality of mIRC. I have also included a very basic script to subvert CTCP fingerprinting.

## Installation and usage
To load the aliases and popups into XChat, you can use the following steps:
1. Save the alias script and popup script in separate files with the extension .py, for example, ctcp.py and popups.py.
2. Open XChat and connect to the desired IRC network and channel.
3. In XChat, go to the "Window" menu and select "Plugins and Scripts" or "List of Plugins" (depending on the version of XChat you are using).
4. In the "Plugins and Scripts" window, click on the "Load..." or "Add..." button.
5. Browse and select the .py files, and click "Open" to load the scripts.
6. Once the scripts are loaded, XChat will automatically execute them, and the aliases and popups will be available for use in the IRC channel and query windows.
7. You should now be able to access the context menus by right-clicking in the channel or query window and see the options that were defined in the scripts.
8. CTCP responses for VERSION will return mIRC version 7.72 and TIME will return the actual UTC +0.

> Make sure you have the necessary permissions to load scripts in XChat, as some IRC networks or security settings may restrict loading external scripts.
